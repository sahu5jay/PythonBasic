        "  Ans-1 Python is a prferable language for programing for data Analytics for its following features like-\n",
        "  1. Simple and eassy to understand.\n",
        "  2. Waste liberary used for the data Analytics.\n",
        "  3. Platform independent can be used in Mac or Windows.\n",
        "  4. Dynamically typed language - code is runned line by line.\n",
        "\n",
        "Que-2 Describe the role of predefined keywords in Python and provide examples of how they are used in a program.\n",
        "  Ans-2 Python language have many predefined keywords which are part of the Python language syntax and cannot be used as variable names, function names, or identifiers.\n",
        "  for ex-\n",
        "  1. if,else - this are in conditional statements.\n",
        "  2. for, while - used in loop iteration.\n",
        "  3. continue, break - for controling the itteration of the loop.\n",
        "  4. and,or,not - operators for checking the conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Que-3 Compare and contrast mutable and immutable objects in Python with examples.\n",
        "  Ans-3 Mutuable are the objects in the python language which can be changed after creation of the objects.\n",
        "  for ex-list,disc, set are the data struture whch can be changed.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Immutable are the object in the language which cannot be changed after creation.\n",
        "  if we try to change the object a new object will be created insteed of making change in that object.\n",
        "  for ex - int, float, string, tuple, bool.\n",

        "Que-4 Discuss the different types of operators in Python and provide examples of how they are used.\n",
        "  Ans-4 Python provide wast types of operator for doing my operation in the program\n",
        "  For ex-\n",
        "  1.Arthematic operator\n",
        "  This operator is used for the calculation of many numerical operation in the program. ex-+,-</,*.\n",
        "  2.Assignment Operators\n",
        "  Used to assign the value to the variable ex-=,+=,=+,etc.\n",
        "  3.Comparison (Relational) Operators\n",
        "  Relational operator ae the operator which are used finding the relation between the two different variable. ex- ==,=>,<=,!=,etc.\n",

        "Que-5 Explain the concept of type casting in Python with examples.\n",
        "  Ans-5 Typecasting is the predefined function which is used to convert one datatype to the other datatype.\n",
        "  the Typecasting are of two types.\n",
        "  1. Implecite typecasting- automatically done by the python\n",
        "  ex a = 5   int\n",
        "     b = 2.0 float\n",
        "     c = a + b result is float\n",
        "     print(c)  Output: 7.0\n",
        "     print(type(c)).\n",
        "  2. Explacite typecasing- done by the programmer ex- int(), float(), str(), bool(), list().\n",

        "Que-6 How do conditional statements work in Python? Illustrate with examples\n",
        "  Ans-6 Contitional statement are the statement which are completeed based on the condition that are provide by the programmer.\n",
        "  this condition is archived using the conditional statement if,ifelse,elif etc.\n",
        "  for ex-\n",

        "  Ans-7 Python uses two different types of loop for the iteration of the loop based on the condition provided in the question.\n",
        "  1.while loop\n",
